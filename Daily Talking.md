# Daily Talking

## Overview
It is a chat tab in my chatGPT account. I have two main chat tabs, Daily Talking and Java Talking. The first is used to ask many questions in large range. The last is for questions as a software engineer. I found that there are too many conversations in Daily Talking. It's not very good because you can't find some question easily if there are too many message. Thus, I want to use this article to store some meaningful questions I asked.

## Questions & Answers

### 1. what is english name of 哆啦A梦?

The English name of 哆啦A梦 is "Doraemon".

### 2. what is '生产资料', which is a concept used by Marx, in english?

"生产资料" is a concept used by Karl Marx in his theory of political economy. In English, it is typically translated as "means of production." The means of production refers to the tools, equipment, and resources used to produce goods and services in a society. In Marxist theory, the means of production are considered to be the foundation of economic systems and social structures, as they determine the way in which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed.

### 3. what are two types of cryptography?

There are two main types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric.

Symmetric cryptography: In symmetric cryptography, also known as secret key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. The sender and receiver must both have a copy of the key, and must both keep it secret, so that no one else can read the encrypted message. Symmetric algorithms are usually faster than asymmetric ones, but the main drawback is the key distribution problem, as the key must be securely exchanged between the sender and the receiver. Examples of symmetric algorithms are AES, DES and Blowfish.

Asymmetric cryptography: In asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, a pair of keys is used for encryption and decryption. One key, called the public key, is used for encryption and the other key, called the private key, is used for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed, while the private key must be kept secret by the owner. Asymmetric algorithms are used for key exchange and digital signature. Examples of asymmetric algorithms are RSA, ECC, and DSA.

It is worth noting that hybrid cryptography is a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, where a symmetric key is used for encrypting the message and an asymmetric key is used for encrypting the symmetric key. This way, the advantages of both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography can be combined in one system.

### 4. is client-side hashing a practical way to improve system's security level?

Client-side hashing is a technique used to improve the security of a system by using cryptographic hashing algorithms on the client side (e.g. browser) before sending sensitive data to the server. The goal of client-side hashing is to prevent sensitive data from being intercepted or compromised in transit between the client and the server.

One of the main use cases for client-side hashing is to protect passwords. Instead of sending a plaintext password to the server, the client hashes the password using a cryptographic algorithm, and then sends the hash to the server. The server can then compare the received hash with a hash of the stored password, without ever having to know the plaintext password.

Client-side hashing can be a practical way to improve the security level of a system, but it is important to note that it is not a replacement for server-side security measures. While client-side hashing can protect against certain types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, it is not effective against other types of attacks, such as those that target the server or the client directly.

Additionally, client-side hashing can be bypassed by an attacker that can execute arbitrary code on the client machine, therefore it is important to use a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) version that is considered to be secure and use salt to increase the complexity of the hash, also it is important to use HTTPS for data transmission.

Client-side hashing can be a useful technique when used in conjunction with other security measures, but it should not be considered a silver bullet solution for improving the security of a system.

### 5. can you explain 2fa method?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a method of authentication that requires the user to provide two forms of identification. The first form of identification is typically something the user knows, such as a password, and the second form of identification is something the user has, such as a physical token or a smartphone app.

There are several types of 2FA methods, some examples are:

SMS-based 2FA: In this method, a one-time code is sent to the user's mobile phone via SMS, which the user then enters to access the system.

Token-based 2FA: In this method, the user is provided with a physical token (such as a key fob) that generates a new code every minute. The user enters this code to access the system.

App-based 2FA: In this method, the user installs a smartphone app that generates a one-time code. The user enters this code to access the system.

Biometric-based 2FA: In this method, the user uses a biometric factor like fingerprint, facial recognition or voice recognition to access the system.

2FA provides an additional layer of security by requiring the user to provide two forms of identification, making it more difficult for an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system. Even if an attacker is able to guess or steal a password, they will not be able to access the system without the second form of identification.

It's worth mentioning that 2FA is not foolproof and it can be bypassed if an attacker has access to both the password and the device (phone, token, etc.) that generates the second factor.
Also, 2FA should not be confused with multi-factor authentication (MFA), which refers to the use of more than two forms of authentication.

### 6. can you explain async/await in javascript?

`async/await` is a JavaScript feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style, making it easier to read and understand.

`async` is a keyword that is used to define an asynchronous function. An asynchronous function is a function that returns a promise and can be paused with the `await` keyword. Here is an example of an asynchronous function that uses the `setTimeout()` function to wait for a certain amount of time before resolving:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Data Received');
    }, 1000);
  });
}
```

`await` is a keyword that is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function and wait for a promise to be resolved. The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. Here is an example of how to use the `await` keyword to call the `getData()` function and wait for the promise to be resolved:

```javascript
async function main() {
  const data = await getData();
  console.log(data); // Output: "Data Received"
}
main();
```

It's important to note that when an await is used, the code following it will not execute until the promise is resolved.

async/await allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, making it easier to... (too long answer to generate one time)

### 7. can you tell me the shortcut about creating html tags in webstorm?

Yes, in WebStorm, you can use the Emmet plugin to quickly create HTML tags and elements. Emmet is a set of tools for writing HTML and CSS faster, it comes pre-installed in WebStorm.

Here are a few examples of the shortcuts you can use to create HTML tags in WebStorm:

* `div` + `Tab`: Creates a `div` element.
* `p` + `Tab`: Creates a `p` element.
* `h1` + `Tab`: Creates an `h1` element.
* `ul>li*3` + `Tab`: Creates an unordered list `ul` with 3 list items `li` inside it.
* `#id` + `Tab`: Creates an element with the `id` attribute set to `id`.
* `.class` + `Tab`: Creates an element with the `class` attribute set to `class`.

You can also chain multiple selectors and attributes together to create more complex elements.

You can also use `Ctrl+Shift+A` (`Cmd+Shift+A` on macOS) and type emmet then select Emmet: Action to see all the available actions and shortcuts.

It's worth mentioning that you can customize the Emmet's default settings to your preference, you can do this by going to `Preferences/Settings` -> `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Emmet`, you can find the settings that you want to customize and change them as you want.

Yes, you can use Emmet shortcuts in Visual Studio Code as well. Emmet is also supported in Visual Studio Code and is enabled by default.

You can also open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and type `emmet` then select the action you want to perform.

You can also customize the Emmet's settings in VS Code by going to `File` -> `Preferences` -> `Settings` and then searching for `Emmet`, you will find the settings that you can change.

### 8. can you explain how to handle data in react js?

Handling data in React involves managing the state and props of a component. The state is a plain JavaScript object that holds data that changes within a component, while props are values passed down from a parent component to its children.

To handle data in React, you can:

* Store state data in the component's state object using the `setState` method
* Pass data from a parent component to its children as props
* Use the React Context API to manage shared state across multiple components
* Fetch data from an external API and store it in the component's state

When a component's state or props change, React re-renders the component to update its view. It's important to keep state updates minimal to prevent unnecessary re-rendering and keep the performance of the application optimal.

### 9. can you explain hook in react detailly?

A hook is a JavaScript function that lets you “hook into” React state and life cycle features from functional components. Hooks are a feature of React and are available in React version 16.8 and later. Hooks are used to manage state and side effects in React functional components.

There are two types of hooks:

1. State Hooks: Used to manage state data within functional components.

2. Effect Hooks: Used to manage side effects within functional components. Side effects refer to operations that are performed in response to a component's state or user interactions.

State Hooks allow functional components to manage their own state data. Effect Hooks allow functional components to manage their own side effects.

Hooks are designed to be easy to use and provide a more intuitive and readable API for React functional components. By using Hooks, you can simplify your code and keep your component logic separated from the component's render logic.

Examples of State Hooks are useState and Examples of Effect Hooks are useEffect.

### 10. please show how i can put a button on the center of a div

You can use CSS to center a button inside a div. Here's an example using display: flex and justify-content: center:

```less
<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', height: '100%'}}>
  <button>Click me</button>
</div>
```

You can also use the text-align property to center the button, but it only works if the parent container has a set width:

```css
<div style={{textAlign: 'center', height: '100%'}}>
  <button>Click me</button>
</div>
```

### 11. can you teach me how to use hook in react?

Certainly! Hooks are a feature in React that allows you to reuse stateful logic across components. Here are a few common hooks:

1. `useState`: This hook is used to add state to a functional component. It returns an array with two elements, the first element is the current state and the second is a function to update the state.
Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. `useEffect`: This hook lets you synchronize a component with an external system, for example, making an API call. It takes a function as its first argument that gets executed after every render.
Example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data))
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. `useContext`: This hook lets you share state across multiple components without passing props down through all of them.
Example:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const MyContext = createContext();

function Child() {
  const value = useContext(MyContext);
  return <p>{value}</p>;
}

function Parent() {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value="Hello World">
      <Child />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

These are the most common hooks, there are more like useReducer, useCallback, useMemo etc. Hooks let you reuse stateful logic without writing a class.

`useReducer` is a Hook in React that allows you to manage the state of your component and update it efficiently, making it an alternative to the useState hook. It is typically used for managing state that is a bit more complex and/or that depends on the previous state.

The `useReducer` hook takes two arguments:

1. A reducer function: This is a pure function that takes the current state and an action and returns the next state. It's responsible for managing the state updates based on the action that's dispatched.

2. An initial state: This is the initial value of the state, and it's passed to the reducer function when the component is first rendered.

Here's an example of how to use useReducer in a React component:

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useReducer` returns an array with two values: the current state (`state`) and a dispatch function (`dispatch`) that you use to update the state. To update the state, you call `dispatch` and pass it an action, which is an object with a `type` property that describes what type of action is being performed. The reducer function takes the current state and the action, and returns the next state.

### 12. can you explain holy trinity?

The Holy Trinity is a central doctrine in Christianity that teaches that there is one God in three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This concept holds that these three persons are distinct, but are of the same substance, equal in power and glory. The doctrine of the Holy Trinity is a cornerstone of the Christian faith and is considered one of the most profound mysteries of the religion. The concept is often depicted symbolically as a triangle, with each person of the Trinity represented by a different corner. The Holy Trinity is a central tenet of the Christian belief system and is central to the worship of many Christian denominations.
