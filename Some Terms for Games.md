# Some Terms for Games

## 1. Introduction

This article is used to list some terms used in games. We non-naive speakers all learn some words in books and journalists, which are very literal and formal. When it comes to daily life, we don't know lots of abbreviations, words and terms in daily life (e.g. idk, idc, lol, ain't...). Therefore it is very necessary for us to know words in daily life, especially in games!
