## 1. Intuition
From my fresh year, I'm very unsatisfied with the electricity restriction at night. The school official believes the policy can help students sleep early. However, I don't like it, or many students don't like it in fact. The policy isn't good for us who like doing our homework, research, and other things at night. Besides that, it's not good for students' finance as well for the reason that students have to use cellular data, which isn't cheap.

Therefore, I want to find a way to bypass the electricity restriction. I've tried many ways, but they all failed. Finally, I found a way to bypass the electricity restriction. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for me.

## 2. The Way

### 2.1 Paid way
There is a way which has spread in students many years to bypass the restriction. The way is to buy electricity in the online store several minutes before 23.30pm. Then, wait 15-20 minutes and electricity will come back. However, this way has been unavailable for about one month. It seems like the school official fixed this 'bug'.

### 2.2 New way (and FREE)
Through the analysis of the electricity online store, I found that the frontend has made the ip address of backend reachable to all customers. That is a very silly mistake for web developers. I can use the ip address to enter into the backend and reconnect our electricity at night.
